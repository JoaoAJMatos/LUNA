## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report security bugs by emailing the security team at: luna.bug.report@gmail.com
<br/>

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and will send a more detailed response indicating the next steps in handling the security issue. 
After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix. 

You may be asked for additional information or guidance.

Depending on the severity of the issue a bug-fixing patch will be released. If the support team doesn't acknowledge the bug as being high priority, the fix will come in the next release.
